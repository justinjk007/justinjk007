### Hello, I am Justin 👋

I am a devops engineer at IBM making sure compilers get built on time and are ready to 🚢. Currently learning some gold standard web development, project management and Flutter in my spare time 🌱. Before I was social distancing I used be a gym rat especially proud of my squats 🏋️. Ask me about index funds 📈 or what kind of fitness routine I follow. For engineering matters you're well off with your search engine.
